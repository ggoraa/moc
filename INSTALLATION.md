# Installation

App distrubuted as an unsigned binary, `cause I'm not a member of Apple Developer Program, so you will need to mitigate some macOS warnings to start the app.

1. Download Release.
You can find latest release at [Releases page](https://github.com/ggoraa/moc/releases), or install using Homebrew by running `brew tap ggoraa/apps` and `brew install moc --cask`, or `brew install ggoraa/apps/moc --cask` if you want a one-liner.

2. Unzip archive and open Moc.dmg

3. Move Moc to Applications folder

4. Open `Moc.app`, macOS will warn you that "Moc" cannnot be opened. This is fine.

1. Go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy. Click "Open Anyway" > "Open"
