If you have any questions, ask them in [Discussions](https://github.com/ggoraa/moc/discussions) on GitHub, or in a [Telegram group](https://t.me/moc_discussion) (ukrainian/russian). You are **strongly** encoruaged to use Discussions and the Telegram group instead of Issues for questions. Bug reports and stuff go to Issues. There is a reason why GitHub created Discussions in the first place :D

# Building

## Step 1 - Download right version of Xcode

The development is going with Xcode 13.3—é. You can download it from
[Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/download/release/).

## Step 2 - Obtain `api_id` and `api_hash`

They can be obtained [here](https://my.telegram.org/). Log in, open **API development tools**, and fill up needed info. Then click **Save changes**
at the bottom of the page. Leave the page open, this will be needed in the next step!

## Step 3 - Set up development environment

Run this command:
```shell
./environment.sh <api_id> <api_hash>
```

**Done!** You have everything set up. You can now build Moc üòÅ
